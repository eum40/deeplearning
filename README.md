**Title:** Life Expectancy Trajectories and Associated Health Indicators among Countries: Temporal Representations of Countries via Deep Learning Architectures

**Introduction:** This deep learning class assignment examines potential patterns in global health by evaluating the evolution of life expectancy and related indicators across countries from 2000 to 2015. The original data I used in this assignment was retrieved from WHO and UN sources. It consists of longitudinal data on demographic, economic, and health system variables.

**Purpose Statement:** My main purpose with this assignment is to apply and compare multiple deep learning architectures (Multilayer Perceptrons [MLPs], Long Short-Term Memory networks [LSTMs], and Autoencoders) to learn  temporal representations of countries based on their life expectancy trajectories and associated health factors. These temporal representations are used for unsupervised clustering to uncover latent health evolution patterns. Basically, I implemented both deep learning methods as well as unsupervised machine learning methods, which aligns with the learning objective of this assignment, specifically working on perceptrons, sequence modeling, optimization strategies, regularization techniques, and unsupervised learning using Keras. Although I use a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, it does not replicate existing Kaggle kernels. Instead, I used new and novel research question focused on learning country-level health trajectory using unsupervised deep learning. The implementation includes custom preprocessing, LSTM Autoencoders, and clustering of latent representations, which go beyond typical regression approaches found in other notebooks.

**Research Question:** Can deep learning models uncover hidden clusters of countries based on how their life expectancy and health indicators evolve over time?
